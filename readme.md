# Markdown to PDF

**A simple CLI tool to convert markdown to pdf**. Uses [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) to convert `markdown` to `html` and [html-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-pdf) to convert `html` to `pdf`. The stylesheet is very simple, it is just meant to be a boilerplate. The whole source code is just ~160 lines (js + css) including comments.

## Installation

Clone repo, then install globally with `npm`:

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/simonhaenisch/md-to-pdf" && cd md-to-pdf

npm i -g
```

Then the command `md-to-pdf` (or alias `md2pdf`) will be globally available from anywhere in your command line.

## Usage

The first argument is `path/to/file.md` and the second one optionally specifies the `path/to/output.pdf`. If you omit the second argument, it will derive the pdf name from the markdown filename and save it into the same directory that contains the markdown file.

```sh
md-to-pdf readme.md
md2pdf readme.md ~/readme.pdf
```

Paths to images can be relative to the markdown file location (or if they are absolute, they need to use the `file://` protocol).

**Page Break:** Place an element with class `page-break` to force a page break at a certain point of the document, e. g.:

```html
<div class="page-break"></div>
```

## Customization

The paper format and borders can be changed in `index.js` (see https://github.com/marcbachmann/node-html-pdf#options for a full list of options). If you don't like the style, just change `markdown.css` to your liking. ~Install globally again (run `npm i -g`) after changing anything to apply the changes.~ NPM 5 uses symlinks, so all changes are reflected immediately without re-installing the package globally.

Pull requests are welcome. Just keep it simple! ðŸ¤“
